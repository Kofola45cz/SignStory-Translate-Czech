This text file is an example of how to, format text and how text is processed.
Below is an example of how the previous text displays on a sign.

First Sign
[This text file ]
[is an example  ]
[of how to,     ]
[format text and]

Second Sign
[how text is    ]
[processed.     ]
[Below is an    ]
[example of how ]

Third Sign
[the previous   ]
[text displays  ]
[on a sign.     ]
[               ]

Essentially how this works is, the mod tries to place as many words onto one line as it can without chopping of the word.

If the word exceeds 15 characters, the mod will chop it up every 15 characters into a new line.
Ex. 
(VeryLargeLargeWord)
[VeryLargeLargeW]
[ord            ]

When placing a new line. Ex(
Lets place a new line. 
Cool Stuff is very nice YAY!
)
The mod will move the next word after the new line into another line.
[Lets place a   ]
[new line.      ]
[Cool Stuff is  ]
[very nice YAY! ]

Instead of:
[Lets place a   ]
[new line. Cool ]
[Stuff is very  ]
[nice YAY!      ]

So there is no need to specialty format your text, as this mod will take care of the formatting.
